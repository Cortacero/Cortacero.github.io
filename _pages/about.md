Hello!

I’m Sergio, a research assistant and science communicator at the University of Granada. I work at the Unit of Excellence in Computational Humanities and Social Sciences [(U-CHASS)](https://uchass.ugr.es/), where I’ve been involved in data analysis, visualization, and science communication.

It’s not my first time working in a research environment. I'm also a member of the [EC3 Research Group](https://ec3-research.com/) and  I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to international projects such as Urban Imprint (2023-1-ES01-KA220-HED-000160257), led by Medialab UGR, and FOM@Play (ERASMUS+ 2022-1-ES01-KA220-HED-000086521), as well as to assist in the organization of the European Science School for Scientometrics.

I’ve also been part of the audiovisual dissemination of academic projects, including the documentary Mujer, Papel y Tijera—part of the FEMENEDIT (P20_00215) and FEMENDATA (A-HUM-684-UGR20) projects—awarded the Silver Biznaga Audience Award at the Málaga International Film Festival 2024. I also collaborated on the production of a report about the exhibition Las Universidades de Carlos V. Patrimonio y Memoria, promoted by the Carolvs Research Group.

Looking back, I’ve realized how central academia has been throughout my career, which led me to start a PhD at the University of Granada. Under the supervision of Dr. Nicolás Robinson-García, my research explores the use of scientific information in parliamentary discourse, examining how it is employed to justify public policy measures.
